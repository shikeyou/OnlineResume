# Online Resume

---

## Introduction

This is Project 2 for Udacity's Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree.

Main objectives of this project:

* Given template HTML codes, use JavaScript to define and load JSON object data into the webpage
* Use jQuery to manipulate the DOM
* Use functions, for-loops, if-statements

## Online Live View

The website is available online for viewing at [http://shikeyou.github.io/OnlineResume/](http://shikeyou.github.io/OnlineResume/)

## Files

These are the files/folders that I have created from scratch:

* **js/resumeBuilder.js:** The main JavaScript file with JSON objects that contains resume data and functions that add these data into the DOM

These are the files/folders that are provided for this project by Udacity:

* **index.html:** The main HTML5 file which contains the structure of the website. Contents are not in this file; they will be populated using JavaScript.

* **js/helper.js:** helper variables and functions necessary to complete this project. Most of the HTML content are provided here as template strings with texts that are meant to be replaced by user-specified data. Slight modifications have been made to get things to work according to the specifications.

* **js/jQuery.js:** jQuery 2.0.3

* **css/styles.css:** Some basic CSS styles

* **images:** Main images folder

## Running The Project

1. Clone the repository

2. Open *index.html* in a web browser (Google Chrome is recommended)
